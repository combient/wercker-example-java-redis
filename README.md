# getting started java redis


[![wercker status](https://app.wercker.com/status/52084dac602bd0033c8ddec62ce72fd1/m "wercker status")](https://app.wercker.com/project/bykey/52084dac602bd0033c8ddec62ce72fd1)

This is an absolutely minimal example of a Java-based multi-docker application, under Continuous Integration by
[Wercker](http://wercker.com/). It consists of two containers:    

- a REST api service and 
- a REDIS key store service. 

The REST api contains one resource which increments a page-hit counter in the REDIS service and prints a greeting 
containing this counter in a text/html response.

## Dev mode

Wercker allows you to run your apps and your dependencies locally - the so called [Dev Mode](http://blog.wercker.com/2015/05/15/Introducing-local-development.html).

To use dev mode you need a docker environment running locally. A convenient way to get this all installed is to download
the [Docker Toolbox](https://www.docker.com/docker-toolbox), and if you are not on Linux you need [Virtualbox](https://www.virtualbox.org/). 

There are several ways of preparing your Docker environment to suit your specific needs. One simplistic method would be:

### Starting your docker-machine

    $ docker-machine start default
                                
### Updating your environment

    $ eval "$(docker-machine env default)"
    
Check your environment variables and make note of the IP assigned to your docker-machine.

### Running your system under Wercker in Dev Mode

    $ cd <your project root = location of wercker.yml>
    $ wercker dev --publish 8082
    
 You should now be able to visit
 
    http://<ip of your docker-machine>:8082/hello
    
    The IP is typically 192.168.99.100. To make sure:
    
    $ env|grep 'DOCKER_HOST'
    
## Known issues

* With the current setup it is not practical to use watch/reload functionality of Wercker Dev Mode. We are looking into this. The solution is likely to be made available as a Wercker Custom Step
* The JUnit test starts an Embedded Jetty and waits for 6 seconds for it to start. A better solution for starting and stopping Jetty between unit tests will be required.
